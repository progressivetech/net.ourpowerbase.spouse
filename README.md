The Spouse extension provides several tokens that allow you to address both a
contact and their partner or spouse together when writing to the primary
contact. The tokens provided are:

 * Partner/Spouse Full Name
 * Partner/Spouse First Name
 * Partner/Spouse Last Name
 * Partner/Spouse Address
 * Partner/Spouse City
 * Partner/Spouse State
 * Partner/Spouse Zipcode
 * Contact and Partner/Spouse first name
 * Contact and Partner/Spouse full name

In addition, the spouse extension will try to disable the partner relationship
if it is not being used to avoid confusion when you have both a spouse and a
partner relationship.
